We'll a lot to unpack here for sho'.

New thing, how to simulate an enter key for the button:

- on the text field, input, page, wherever you want to look for key downs, you add this property:
  onKeyDown={handleKeyPress}

- then you previously should have defined this, "enter" code is 13:
const handleKeyPress = (e) => {
    // look for the `Enter` keyCode
    if (e.keyCode === 13 || e.which === 13) {
      callApi()
    }
  }
